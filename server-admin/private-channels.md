# Hiding and locking channels for specific roles
Need private channels for your mods, or just want to talk to your friends without people spying on you?

### Step 1: Create channels
First we need to create a few channels for our private, ehrm, *business*.
Create some using the plus buttons

This will bring up a window wherein you can select the name, and basic permissions about the new channel.  
The permissions you can select here refer to `Read Messages` permission, but we'll set up more later.

### Step 2: Setting up permissions
Now that we have a channel, it's time to set permissions up, incase you forgot to check roles when first creating the channel, or when you want to give specific people access.

- Select `Edit Channel`

- Goto `Permissions`

Now, we can define who can and who can't access this channel.

- Add some roles or people to the list

- Select what each role can and can't do

> Pro tip: the @everyone role refers all people who don't have special permissions for this channel 

You can also select people instead of roles to set permissions for them.

> Server owners always can read all channels, you cannot block them from channels in their own server

The same process applies to voice channels.

And that's it! You now have private channels for people!
