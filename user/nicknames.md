# Nicknames

Server nicknames are an amazing addition to discord that greatly helps differentiate your identity between communities,
they are server specific vanity names that do not affect your main username.

## Setting your username
>To be able to set your nickname on any given server, you must possess the `Change Nickname` permission on said server.

There are multiple ways of setting your nickname, the first using the command `/nick [nick]`, `[nick]` being the desired Nickname, you shall receive a message similar to:

If you do not have the `Change Nickname` permission, you shall receive this message:
![clydefail](https://my.mixtape.moe/qecbrd.png)


An alternative way to set your username is using the right click on the server icon in the server list:

Using this method you can also use the  `reset nickname` option to delete your nickname on your desired server to your account username.

##Setting other's nicknames
>To be able to set the nickname of others on any given server you must possess the `Manage Nickname` permission on said server, and be higher in the role hierarchy than the person whose nickname you are trying to edit.
